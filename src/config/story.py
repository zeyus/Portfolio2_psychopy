    Once upon a time a spoon and a fork fell in love.
    They got married, and on the day of their fifth anniversary they went to a
    wonderful restaurant. They were still madly in love and enjoyed each other’s company.
    Live music filled the restaurant, and the couple stared into each other’s eyes.
    They shared a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. After the dinner, the fork gave
    the spoon a neatly wrapped anniversary gift. It was tickets to Paris,
    and the spoon was {cond_word} and felt excited that they were finally
    going to see the beautiful city together. They kissed and went home to watch a movie.
